# Landing Page v1 Plan (Initial)

## Phase 1 — Student-Focused Landing (Done)
- One-page landing with student-first messaging
- Sections: hero, features, exam tracks, outcomes, prep flow, CTA
- Theme toggle + premium badge styling

## Phase 2 — Dynamic Content (Next)
- Drive sections from CMS (`GET /cms/public`)
- Add plans/pricing widget (`GET /plans`)
- Wire student login CTA

Expected modules to validate against backend:
- CMS public content (`/cms/public`)
- Public pages (`/cms/pages/:slug`)
- Banners and announcements
- Home sections rendering
- SEO and analytics tags

Do not implement until the landing page chat is analyzed.
